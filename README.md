# ContactFinder
A Python Script that can be used to find phone numbers and email addresses on your clipboard.

## How It Works

This Python script uses the pyperclip and the re module. I used RegEx to match the data types of a typical phone number and an email address. The steps you have to follow for my program to work are the following:

1. Go to a website's 'Contact Us' page and then Select All the stuff on the screen using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+A.
2. After you have selected everything using the shortcut, you should proceed to copy everything on the page using Ctrl+C.
3. Now proceed to run the script.
4. You will then receive a list of all the phone numbers and email addresses that were copied on your clipboard.
5. It works from all sources of data as long as you get to Copy-Paste everything.
